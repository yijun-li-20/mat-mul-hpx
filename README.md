## Readme

### Overview
- This is a very simple example to build hpx on my local workstation with a demo
- The matmul.cpp file is from the original hpx repository
- The CMakeLists.txt is modified from the hello world client example.

### Build with CMake
- With CMake GUI, set this path as a source code path, and set another path out of this repository as the built binaries.
- Besides the default configurations, add a few more:
    - `SETUP_TYPE=TARGETS`
    - `HPX_DIR=$HPX_BUILD/lib/cmake/HPX`
    - `HPX_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY=$HPX_INSTALL`
- Configure and generate, open VS in privileged mode
- Build the target and run fron command line
